Managing API versioning in a Spring Boot application is essential to ensure compatibility and smooth transitions as your API evolves. There are several approaches to handle API versioning. Here, I'll explain two common methods: URI Versioning and Request Header Versioning. Choose the one that best suits your requirements.

**1. URI Versioning:**

In URI versioning, the API version is included in the URL itself. This is a straightforward approach and is suitable when you want clear version separation.

Example:
```shell
GET /api/v1/books
```

Here's how you can implement URI versioning in Spring Boot:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/books")
public class BookControllerV1 {
    // Controller code for version 1
}
```

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v2/books")
public class BookControllerV2 {
    // Controller code for version 2
}
```

**2. Request Header Versioning:**

In request header versioning, the API version is specified in an HTTP header, such as "Accept" or a custom header like "X-API-Version."

Example:

```shell
GET /api/books
Header: Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json
```

Here's how you can implement request header versioning in Spring Boot:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/books")
public class BookController {
    
    @GetMapping(produces = "application/vnd.myapp.v1+json")
    public List<Book> getAllBooksV1() {
        // Controller code for version 1
    }

    @GetMapping(produces = "application/vnd.myapp.v2+json")
    public List<Book> getAllBooksV2() {
        // Controller code for version 2
    }
}
```

In both approaches, you should add appropriate logic to handle version-specific requirements within the controllers. Keep in mind that API versioning should be done carefully to minimize breaking changes and ensure a smooth transition for API consumers.

You can also consider using third-party libraries or implementing custom versioning strategies based on your specific needs, such as path parameters or custom request headers.
