Comprehensive example of API Gateway configuration using Spring Cloud Gateway, including comments for multiple paths and complete configurations:

```yaml
# API Gateway Configuration with Spring Cloud Gateway

## Dependency Configuration

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml` (if using Maven) or `build.gradle` (if using Gradle) for Spring Cloud Gateway:

```xml
<!-- Spring Cloud Gateway -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Basic Configuration

1. **Application Properties (`application.properties` or `application.yml`):**

   Define the routes and any global configurations for your API Gateway:

   ```yaml
   spring:
     cloud:
       gateway:
         routes:
           - id: employee-service
             uri: lb://employee-service
             predicates:
               - Path=/employee/**
               - Path=/employees/**
               - Path=/employee-details/**
           - id: department-service
             uri: lb://department-service
             predicates:
               - Path=/department/**
   ```

   In this configuration:
   - The `employee-service` route has multiple path predicates:
     - `Path=/employee/**`: Routes requests with paths starting with `/employee/`.
     - `Path=/employees/**`: Routes requests with paths starting with `/employees/`.
     - `Path=/employee-details/**`: Routes requests with paths starting with `/employee-details/`.
   - The `department-service` route has a single path predicate:
     - `Path=/department/**`: Routes requests with paths starting with `/department/`.

## Global Configuration

You can also set global configurations for your API Gateway in `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: employee-service
          uri: lb://employee-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/employee/**
            - Path=/employees/**
            - Path=/employee-details/**
```
