# CSRF Protection in Spring Boot

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in Spring Boot is a crucial security feature that guards against CSRF attacks. This feature ensures the authenticity of requests and prevents unauthorized actions on authenticated users. Here's an explanation, a use case, example code, and best configurations for CSRF protection in Spring Boot.

## Description

CSRF protection in Spring Boot is designed to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. These attacks occur when malicious actors trick a user's browser into making unauthorized requests on a site where the user is authenticated. CSRF tokens are employed to validate the legitimacy of requests and thwart such attacks.

## Use Case

Imagine a banking application where a user is authenticated. Without CSRF protection, attackers could deceive the user's browser into making unauthorized financial transactions. CSRF protection ensures that the request is valid, safeguarding the user from these fraudulent actions.

## Example Code

### Configure CSRF Protection

In your Spring Boot application's configuration class, enable CSRF protection by configuring `CsrfFilter`:

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.web.csrf.CsrfFilter;
import org.springframework.security.web.csrf.CsrfTokenRepository;
import org.springframework.security.web.csrf.HttpSessionCsrfTokenRepository;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public CsrfTokenRepository csrfTokenRepository() {
        HttpSessionCsrfTokenRepository repository = new HttpSessionCsrfTokenRepository();
        repository.setHeaderName("X-XSRF-TOKEN"); // Header name to use for CSRF token
        return repository;
    }

    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean<CsrfFilter> csrfFilter() {
        FilterRegistrationBean<CsrfFilter> filter = new FilterRegistrationBean<>(new CsrfFilter(csrfTokenRepository()));
        filter.addUrlPatterns("/secured/*"); // Define URL patterns to protect
        return filter;
    }
}
```

### Include CSRF Token in HTML Forms

Include the CSRF token in your HTML forms using the header name defined in the configuration (e.g., "X-XSRF-TOKEN"):

```html
<form method="post" action="/secured/transaction">
   <input type="hidden" name="${_csrf.parameterName}" value="${_csrf.token}" />
   <!-- Other form fields -->
   <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## Best Configurations for CSRF Protection

1. Use a **randomized CSRF token** for each session to ensure unpredictability.
2. Configure **proper content types** for CSRF protection to avoid false positives.
3. Consider using **double-submit cookies** to store the CSRF token in a cookie as well as in the request.
4. Use **HttpOnly cookies** for the session to protect against session fixation attacks.
5. Carefully define the **URL patterns** to protect with CSRF. Protect critical actions, such as transactions and account updates.

These configurations enhance the effectiveness of CSRF protection in your Spring Boot application. CSRF tokens should be present in forms and validated on the server to prevent unauthorized requests.
