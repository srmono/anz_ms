# Spring Modulith (Modular Monolith)

**Spring Modulith**, also known as the Modular Monolith, is an architectural pattern introduced by the Spring framework. It aims to address the challenges of building large, monolithic applications while embracing a more modular and scalable approach. This pattern allows developers to create a monolithic application that is logically divided into independent modules, combining the best of monoliths and microservices.

## Structure

1. **Core Module**:
   - The core module serves as the foundation of the application and contains common code and shared libraries.
   
2. **Feature Modules**:
   - Feature modules encapsulate specific application features or use cases.
   - Examples include user management, product catalog, order processing, and more.

3. **API Module**:
   - The API module defines contracts and APIs that other modules can use to interact with its features.

4. **Infrastructure Module**:
   - The infrastructure module provides technical capabilities, including database access, caching, messaging, and integration with external services.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Independently Deployable**:
   - Each module is deployable as a standalone unit, allowing for independent scaling and updates.

2. **Loose Coupling**:
   - Modules interact through well-defined APIs, reducing tight coupling between different parts of the application.

3. **Shared Core**:
   - A shared core module reduces code duplication and manages common functionality.

4. **Consistent Technology Stack**:
   - Modules use a consistent technology stack, such as Spring Boot, simplifying development and deployment.

5. **DevOps Practices**:
   - DevOps practices like Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are applied to individual modules.

6. **Scalability**:
   - Modules can be independently scaled based on demand.

7. **Testing**:
   - Modules can be tested independently, making it easier to maintain a high level of test coverage.

## Use Case Example

**Scenario**: You are developing an e-commerce platform using the Spring Modulith pattern.

**Use of Spring Modulith**:

- **Core Module**:
  - Includes shared components like authentication and logging.

- **Feature Modules**:
  - User management, product catalog, and order processing are represented as feature modules, each with its APIs.
  - New features like a loyalty program can be developed and deployed independently as additional feature modules.

- **Infrastructure Module**:
  - Handles database access and integrates with payment gateways.

Spring Modulith enables a balanced approach to application development. It combines the maintainability of monolithic applications with the scalability and modularity of microservices. This pattern is particularly valuable when evolving a large application toward a more microservices-oriented architecture incrementally.
